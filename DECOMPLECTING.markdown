# On Decomplecting

A technique that I've found useful in my programming career is the application of lenses.  To explain what this means allow me to use [Clojure](http://www.clojure.org) as an example.

That is, while I've found Clojure a highly useful tool in building work and hobby projects, I think more than anything else I've found its principles more important.  In other words, while Clojure is a wonderful tool in its own right, it's a much better "lens" for viewing computing:[^others]

Or for viewiing systems architecture:

Or maybe even databases, a very good example being [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com):

But what happens when that lens is truned onto Clojure itself?
