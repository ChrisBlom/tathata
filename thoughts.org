* Thoughts

/Goal/ - To restore pods and make them more generic by designing
protocols for extension.  To document pods in a way that makes them
clear to most (myself included).  Demonstrate how to use reader
conditionals.  Support Clojure 1.8+ only.

** Tasks

*** INPR - Thoroughly document
*** INPR - Create example showing data-struct-like behavior
*** INPR - Create example showing pod-like behavior
*** TODO - Write more tests
*** TODO - Integrate reader conditionals at a naive level (CLJ-only)
*** TODO - Integrate CLJS code via reader conditionals
*** TODO - Write blog post
*** TODO - Code-clean for final release.
